# LED-Strip-Progress
This is for a Sword from Final Fantasy XIV called the Woeborn.
The idea is to have multiple strip lights activated at one time along with some singular LEDs all active at the same time.
Idealy they will all glow/pulse through diffsuer foam.
The scale of the sword will be 1:1 so the amount of LEDs needed will increase.
